                    I'm great at Python, HTML, and C, with good working knowledge in Java, C++, and C#.<br>

                    <h3>Python 1 Final Project - Emu Brawl</h3>
                    <img src= "Images/Australia.png" alt="Australia">
                    <p>
                        Developed in Highschool Python 1 course, which goes over basic Python programming development. This is the first major 
                        project I ever developed, and used what tools I had available from the class to create a game which I titled "Emu Brawl".
                        Emu Brawl is a text based "adventure" game which involves using a rock paper sissors system (turned into hit, shoot, and deflect)
                        to fight enemies with specific skillsets. These enemies have different probabilities of picking certain options over another, like
                        a kangaroo is more likely to hit then deflect, and cannot shoot at all. The game itself went way over the expectations of the
                        assignment, and became more of a passion project for me to explore how far my Python skills could go at that current point. When
                        looking back on it, there are many ways this program can be optimized, which demonstrates a good growth in my programming knowledge
                        and how far I've improved since I began.

                    <img src= "Images/DiscordLogo.png" alt="Discord Logo">
                    <p>
                        Bobby Blooper is a passion project discord bot developed in October 2024. It is the successor to my previous bot, Beanos-Bot, which was
                        named after my first discord handle and lost after a file transfer error. Bobby Blooper is able to perform a large list of tasks, which so far
                        consists of:
                        <ul>
                        <li>A basic greeting to the user</li>
                        <li>Tell a joke</li>
                        <li>Coin flip</li>
                        <li>8 ball responses</li>
                        <li>Random fortune cookie slip</li>
                        <li>Random number generator</li>
                        <li>Match % of 2 users</li>
                            <ul><li>This % will be assigned for the two users until the bot restarts</li></ul>
                        <li>Play rock paper siccors</li>
                        <li>Play would you rather</li>
                        <li>Assign a One Piece character to a user</li>
                            <ul><li>This character will be assigned to the user until the bot restarts</li></ul>
                        <li>Generate a random One Piece bounty</li>
                        <li>A mini-dungeon campaign</li>
                            <ul><li>A random text adventure, consisting of 20 dungeon floors and a final Cyclops boss</li></ul>
                            <ul><li>Events are pulled from a random list and has a corresponding randomized outcome</li></ul>
                            <ul><li>Health, items, gold, and inventory are all managed for each user</li></ul>
                            <ul><li>Progress will remain assigned until the bot restarts</li></ul>
                        </ul>
                        This project is currently a work in progress and is still being updated with new features. Eventually,
                        a more polished version will be published to Github as development continues.
